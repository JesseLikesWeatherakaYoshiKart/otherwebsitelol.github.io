<h3>Note Made on June 24th 2023:</h3>

<h2>We are sorry for our website not working yesterday. The api key function had expired. However, we have replaced it with a new one. Again, we are sorry if you had trobuleshooting.</h2>

<h3>We are returning our original script, but a couple of edits. Keep in mind I am adding cities to the list xd.</h3>
